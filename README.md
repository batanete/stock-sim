# stock-sim

This project contains a simulator(using previous data) for the performance of a stock market portfolio.
It works by web scraping past data on them from the internet according to their symbol, using the websites posted below.

## Configuration
Set up your portfolio in the json file, according to the example shown.

## Running
To run it use the following commands on the (python3 needed):
* pip3 install 


## TODO
This is a small hobby project that I may work on from time to time, but the following may be added in the future:
* A UI to set up the config, instead of using a JSON file.
* Support for ETF's in the portfolio(would require finding proper websites with the data).
* Use scrappy instead of beautiful soup(better performance on the scrapping process).

## Website credit

So far, the following websites are scrapped:
